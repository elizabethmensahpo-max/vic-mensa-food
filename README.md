Welcome to Vic Mensa Food Store, a little corner of joy tucked in the lively streets of Asokwa Old Town, Kumasi.
Here, every dish tells a story of tradition, care, and the true taste of Ghana.
Our steaming Waakye comes piled high with perfectly seasoned sides — gari, spaghetti, boiled egg, ripe plantain — pure comfort in every spoonful.
Our Jollof dances with smoky spice and tender grilled chicken that falls off the bone.
Kelewele crackles with heat and crunch, waking up your taste buds with every bite.
And when the day calls for something soulful, our soft Fufu swims in rich, peppery light soup with goat, chicken or fish — a hug on a plate.
We believe good food should be easy to enjoy. That’s why we created a simple touch-screen menu right at the counter — tap your choice, add to cart, pay with MoMo or cash, and your meal is on the way.
Vic Mensa Food Store isn’t just a place to eat… it’s a place to feel at home, to share laughter, and to taste the heartbeat of Kumasi.
We’re waiting for you with open arms and hot pots.
Come chop with us.
